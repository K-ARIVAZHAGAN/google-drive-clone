# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# This workflow performs a static security analysis of your source code using
# Fortify on Demand (FoD). This workflow is intended for applications that 
# are already onboarded to FoD. If you are not using FoD, you can remove this file.
# 
# IMPORTANT: This workflow requires valid Fortify on Demand credentials.
# To use this workflow, you must:
# 1. Sign up for Fortify on Demand at https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/products/application-security-testing/overview
# 2. Onboard your application to FoD
# 3. Configure the following repository secrets:
#    - FOD_URL: Your FoD instance URL
#    - FOD_TENANT: Your FoD tenant ID
#    - FOD_USER: Your FoD username
#    - FOD_PASSWORD: Your FoD password
#    - FOD_RELEASE_ID: Your FoD release ID
#
# If these secrets are not configured, the workflow will be skipped automatically.
