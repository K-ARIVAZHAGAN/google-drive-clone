IMPORTANT NOTE FOR EVALUATOR:
Free Tier Cold Start: The Backend is hosted on Render's Free Tier, which "sleeps" after inactivity.
PLEASE CLICK THE BACKEND LINK ABOVE FIRST and wait for it to say "Google Drive Clone API is running" before using the Frontend.
This ensures the server is awake and ready to handle requests.

1. What is Google Drive?

Google Drive is a file storage and synchronization service developed by Google. It allows users to store files on their servers, synchronize files across devices, and share files.
In this application: We have replicated this core functionality, allowing users to store, manage, and retrieve files from any internet-connected device without downloading a desktop application.

2. How do I Develop a Google Drive Application?

This project implements the complete development lifecycle as requested:

A. Authentication System
We designed a complete system covering Login, Registration, and Forgot Password.

*   User Data: Stored in MongoDB Atlas.
    *   firstName & lastName: Collected during registration.
    *   email: Used as the unique Username.
    *   password: Encrypted using bcryptjs before storage.
*   Two-Step Activation Workflow:
    1.  Sign Up: User enters details. An account is created with isVerified: false.
    2.  Email Activation: We use Resend API to send a verification link with a randomized token.
    3.  Activation: Clicking the link verifies the token and updates the user to isVerified: true.
    4.  Login Guard: Unverified users are blocked from logging in with a specific error message.
*   Forgot Password Flow:
    1.  User clicks "Forgot Password" and enters their email.
    2.  System validates email and sends a reset link (with a temporary token).
    3.  User clicks link, enters new password.
    4.  System updates password (hashed) and invalidates the token.

B. Dashboard & Application Logic

*   Dashboard Design:
    *   Built with React and Tailwind CSS.
    *   Displays Folders and Files in a grid layout.
    *   Shows creation timestamps for all items.
    *   Responsive Design: Includes Mobile Hamburger Menu.
*   Folder Management:
    *   (+) Button allows users to create nested folders.
    *   Folder hierarchy is managed via parentFolderId in MongoDB.
*   File Upload & Storage (AWS S3):
    *   Drag & Drop: Implemented using react-dropzone.
    *   Storage: Files are uploaded effectively to a private AWS S3 Bucket.
    *   Security: Users can only view/download their own files.
    *   Metadata: File path, size, type, and ownership linked in MongoDB.

3. Technology Stack

*   Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Axios, React Router, React Hot Toast.
*   Backend: Node.js, Express.js.
*   Database: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud NoSQL Database).
*   Storage: AWS S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service).
*   Email: Resend API (Transactional Email Service).
*   Deployment: Vercel (Frontend) & Render (Backend).
